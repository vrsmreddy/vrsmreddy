#  🌱 ABOUT ME
# =====================================================================================
#  I am a Master’s student in Computer and Information Sciences at the University of
#  Florida, aiming to graduate in May 2025. My areas of focus include machine learning
#  (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language models (LLMs). I’m passionate about
#  building cutting-edge solutions and solving real-world challenges with research and
#  scalable architectures.

#  💼 WORK EXPERIENCE
# =====================================================================================
#  1. Research Assistant
#     - 🏫 Institution: SRM Institute of Science and Technology
#     - ⏰ Duration: August 2022 – July 2023 | Chennai, India
#     - 🔑 Key Achievements:
#       * Created an end-to-end pipeline using scikit-learn and MediaPipe for real-time
#         hand tracking and ASL gesture recognition, reaching 95% accuracy on a 2,626-sample dataset.
#       * Implemented ML algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, KNN), selecting the best for
#         continuous data streams.
#       * Deployed an OpenCV-based GUI supporting near-real-time inference (20–30 FPS).
#
#  2. Software Engineer Intern – Machine Learning
#     - 🏢 Organization: Smart Knower
#     - ⏰ Duration: January 2022 – March 2022 | Chennai, India
#     - 🔑 Key Achievements:
#       * Reduced DDR5 DIMM inventory processing time by 97.2% (180s → 5s) using
#         a deep learning-based OCR system.
#       * Achieved a remarkably low Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.1 by fine-tuning PaddleOCR,
#         outperforming closed-source OCR solutions.
