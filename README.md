## üíº Work Experience

### üî¨ Research Assistant  
**SRM Institute of Science and Technology** | Aug 2022 ‚Äì July 2023 | Chennai, India  
- Built an end-to-end **ML classification pipeline** integrating **scikit-learn** and **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition, achieving **95% accuracy** on a 2,626-sample ASL dataset.  
- Benchmarked **Random Forest, SVM, and KNN** to identify the optimal model (Random Forest) and automated data preprocessing for continuous data streams.  
- Developed a user-friendly **OpenCV GUI** to enable near‚Äìreal-time inference (20‚Äì30 FPS).

### üíª Software Engineer Intern ‚Äì Machine Learning  
**Smart Knower** | Jan 2022 ‚Äì Mar 2022 | Chennai, India  
- Accelerated **DDR5 DIMM inventory** processing by **97.2%** (from 180‚Üí5 seconds per unit) using a **deep learning‚Äìbased OCR** system.  
- Achieved a remarkably low **Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.1** by fine-tuning **PaddleOCR**, surpassing the accuracy of closed-source OCR solutions.

## üöÄ Projects

### LLM-Augmented ResNet50 Classification
- **Stack:** PyTorch, Hugging Face, QLoRA, ImageNet, Ollama, RAG  
- Developed an **LLM-augmented ResNet50** classification system, tuning over **25.6M+ parameters** to reach **99.90% confidence** across 10 image classes.  
- Employed **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT)** with QLoRA for optimal performance, ensuring **90%+ Pearson correlation** in user evaluations.  

### Streamline Segmentation from Earth Imagery
- **Stack:** TensorFlow Keras, U-Net, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  
- Deployed a **U-Net** with **multi-channel inputs** (RGB, NIR, DEM, LiDAR intensity, slope), achieving **94.6% accuracy** on 15,500+ samples.  
- Implemented **dropout (20%)** and callbacks to reduce learning rate upon metric plateaus, ensuring stable and robust model performance.
